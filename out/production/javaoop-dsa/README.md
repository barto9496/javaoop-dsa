## OOP Concepts in Java
As the name suggests OOP refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is 
to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user performing tasks assigned by you. OOP aims to implement real-world entities 
like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operated on 
the so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

Let us discuss prerequisites by polising concepts of method declaration and message passing. Starting off with the method declaration, it consists
of six components:

### Access Modifier
Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers:
1. public: accessible to all classes in your function
2. protected: accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es) (including subclasses outside the package).
3. private: accessible only within the class in which it is defined 
4. default(declared / defined without using any modifier): Accessible withing the same class and package within which its class is defined.

### Return Type 
The data type of the value returned by the method or void if it does not return a value. 

### Method Name
The rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different

### Parameter list
Comma-separated list of the input parameters that are defined, preceded by their data type, within the enclosed parentheses. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().

### Exception list
The exceptions you expect the method to throw. YOu can specify these exceptions(s).

### Method body
It is the block of code enclosed between braces, that you need to execute to perform you intended operations.
